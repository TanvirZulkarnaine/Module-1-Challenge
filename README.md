## Overview of Project
I created two pivot tables and their respective line graphs. First task is to display the "outcomes (successful, failed, or canceled)" based on the launch date (in months) for the parent category "theater" fundraising project. Second task is to display the "outcomes (successful, failed, or canceled)" based on the goal (monetary) made by the project leader.
### Purpose
The purpose for this project is to create the pivot tables and their respective graphs, analyze the data, and learn from the data so that we can have Louise have a successful fundraising project for her play. Thus we filtered into all the relevent fields (theater, play, outcomes, goal) from the data.  
## Analysis and Challenges
I had to use formulas and functions such as COUNTIFS(), YEAR(), SUM(), etc, on the data to show accurate results. One challange that I faced during this project is to calculate the percentage failed/succeeded/canceled as I did not know how to distribute the percentage so that it added up to 100%.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Month of May had the highest success to fail rate and also has the highest number of fundraising projects. Also, for some odd reason, no projects were canceled from beginning of September to end of October, thus it had a sharp spike in fail rate as well as success rate. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
One simple trend that I found is that higher goal implies higher percentage of fail. However, projects with goal of $35,000 to $44,999 had higher success percentage than fail.   
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Again, calculating the percentage distribution was the challenging part for me on this project. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    I have noticed that the number of fundraising projects have spiked in numbers during the month of May from the gathered years. Also, Success ratio to failure is also much higher on May compared to the other the months. Thus, it is a good month to start a fundraiser! 

    Another point I noticed is that, there are no projects canceled from the beginning of September to end of October. Projects either fail or succeed in this timeframe. Since there is no projects to be canceled, I noticed that there is a somewhat sharp spike in failed projects. Since projects can't be canceled, it is probably not the best month to start your fundraising project unless you come prepared. 

    I also noticed that, overall, many projects succeed than fail!

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    After analyzing the date plot, I have come to the conclusion that fundraising projects about "plays" with a lower goal is more likely to succeed and projects with very high goal will fail often. There are some balance points in the plot where percentage of failure is equal to percentage of success for 15000 to 19999, 35000 to 39999, and 40000 to 44999 goal ranges. I also notice that there are two projects that succeeded with over $50,000 goal. These are probably outliars, but I cannot say for certain without doing further analysis. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    One limitation that comes to mind is that the average donation could be altered massively. Let's suppose an extreme example: we have 2 backers and one of the backer is solo funded 99% of the fundraising goal and the other backer funded 1%. This result in the backer funding 99% of the money being an outliar. Thus, I came to a conclusion that outliars can change our dataset which would reduce the accuracy of our dataset. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    There are many tables or graps we can create. For example, we can create outcomes based on countries. As I am very sure, there could be some plays that are more popular in one country but it is not in another country.
